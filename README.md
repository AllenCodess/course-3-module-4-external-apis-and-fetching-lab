
# Lab: External APIs and Fetching

## Introduction

You’ve just joined the front-end development team of a national safety awareness organization. Your first assignment is to build a web application that fetches weather alerts from the National Weather Service API for a specific U.S. state. The app should dynamically display relevant alert headlines and handle edge cases like invalid input and network errors.

This lab will strengthen your skills in using the `fetch()` API, working with JSON data, handling user input, and manipulating the DOM—all essential in modern web development.

## Tools & Resources

## Set Up

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   - Go to the provided GitHub repository link.
   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   - Open the project in VSCode.
   - Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
   - Use `open index.html` or `explorer.exe index.html` to open in browser.
   - Use `npm test` to run the test suite.

## Instructions

1. Fetch Alerts for a Given State

Create a function that takes a U.S. state abbreviation (e.g., "NY") and uses `fetch()`
to request data from the National Weather Service Alerts API:

```javascript
`https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?area=${STATE_ABBR}`
```

Replace `STATE_ABBR` with the user’s input value. Handle network and API errors
gracefully.

2. Display the Alerts

When the fetch is successful, show:

* A summary message using the `title` property and number of alerts (under the `features` key) in the data from the API response, like:  
   * "Current watches, warnings, and advisories for Minnesota: 11"
* A list of alert headlines, each as its own line or bullet.
   * Each alert is available as an array under `features` and each alert headline is available under `properties.headline` in the array.

3. Clear and Reset the UI

Each time the user fetches new data:

* Clear the input field.
* Update the weather alerts display with fresh data, removing any previous data.

4. Error Handling

When something goes wrong (e.g., empty input, bad state code, or network failure):

* Display the message in the error.
   * from `.catch` this can be accessed using the `message` key:
```javascript
.catch(errorObject => console.log(errorObject.message))
```
* Show the message in a dedicated `<div id="error-message">`.
* Ensure this div is hidden and text is cleared when the next successful request is made.

## BONUS: Additional Features

Explore additional features to further improve the application:

### `loading` Indicator

Add a loading spinner while fetching data to improve user experience:

```js
function showLoadingSpinner() {
  spinnerElement.style.display = 'block';
}

function hideLoadingSpinner() {
  spinnerElement.style.display = 'none';
}
```

### Error Styling

Use CSS classes to style error messages dynamically:

```js
function displayError(message) {
  errorElement.textContent = message;
  errorElement.classList.add('error');
}
```

### Input Validation

Validate that user input is two capital letters before making the request.

## Test and Refine

Use the included Jest tests by running `npm test` to validate:

* The fetch request is made using the input state abbreviation.
* When a successful fetch request is made, the title of the data along with the number 
of alerts is displayed (i.e. 'Current watches, warnings, and advisories for New York: 
7')
* When the 'Get Weather Alerts' button is clicked, the input clears.
* When an unsuccessful request is made the error message is displayed.
* Error messages are cleared and hidden after a successful request.

## Document and Maintain

Once all tests are passing and the app is working as expected, push your working code to GitHub and submit.

```bash
git commit -am "final solution"
git push origin main
```
